# Overview

- CLI for simplifying in-database transformation pipelines
- Relies primarily on select statements
- First class support for data tests
- Macro system for extensibility
- Primary commands:
  - dbt run
  - dbt test
- https://github.com/dbt-labs

# schema.yml

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: salary_by_department
    columns:
      - name: department_name
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
  - name: employee_dependents
    columns:
      - name: employee_id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
```

---

# Transformations are select statements

`/models/salary_by_department.sql`

```sql
{{ config(materialized="view") }}

select
    departments.department_name,
    count(1) as employee_count,
    min(employees.salary) as min_salary,
    max(employees.salary) as max_salary,
    sum(employees.salary) as sum_salary
from employees
left join departments
    on employees.department_id = departments.department_id
group by departments.department_name
order by departments.department_name
```

---

# Pipelines are declarative

- Dependencies expressed using the `ref` function
- Intuitive and less error-prone compared to sequential SQL

`/models/unwrapped.sql`

```sql
select
    json_array_elements(array_data) as unwrapped
from some_table
```

`/models/flattened.sql`

```sql
select
    unwrapped->>'field_1' as field_1,
    unwrapped->>'field_2' as field_2,
    unwrapped->>'field_3' as field_3,
    unwrapped->>'field_4' as field_4,
from {{ ref("unwrapped") }}
```

---

# First class testing support

- Built-in data tests that are easy to write
  - Bespoke
  - Generic
- Works well with CI/CD systems (translate data correctness issues into build failures)

---

# Bespoke tests

`/tests/salary_fields_are_monotone.sql`

```sql
select *
from {{ ref("salary_by_department") }}
where not (min_salary <= max_salary and max_salary <= sum_salary)
```

`/tests/some_table_is_not_empty.sql`

```sql
select *
from (select count(1) as c from some_table) as t
where c = 0
```

---

# Test macros

`/macros/model_is_not_empty.sql`

```sql
{% test not_empty(model) %}
    select *
    from (select count(1) as c from {{ model }}) as t
    where c = 0
{% endtest %}
```

Then use within any model config YAML:

```yaml
---
version: 2

models:
  - name: some_table
    tests:
      - not_empty
```

---

# Downsides

- More than one way to perform data tests (flexible but also confusing)
  - Start with bespoke tests and parametrize early
- Not always easy to express test assertions as select statements
- Source data can only be tested using bespoke tests
  - Create thin model wrapper as a workaround
- Macro capabilities may lead to spaghetti code
- Somewhat clumsy abstractions: properties vs. configuration vs. schema
